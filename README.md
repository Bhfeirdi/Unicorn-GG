 # 3. Design
 
Design Choices:
I wanted the site to have one very clear choice in terms of overall design. It should in part emulate the space it is advertising. Bright, open, intriguing, loud, clear and intentional.
 
Colour:
Please see attached colour palette. These were central to all choices from background blamket colour, logo, text and footer and were emulated in the imagery posted throughout to attempt a cohesive set of colour choices that emulate the vibrancy of the space.

A mixture of verdana, sans serif and ptrounded were chosen to be the sole font throughout with minor spacing, scaling, colour and weight changes to keep a clean aesthetic.

# 7. Bugs
In any image of the home page and about page you can clearly see the triplets of images are not centred. I could not find a way to adjust them the small amount needed without throwing out the entire format of the page.

Also, I could not make the nav bar fall further into the left margin when scaled down to iPhone 5 size. Perhaps a hamburger menu would have been best at that scale.

Ther is a warning in the WAVE test about two links too close together but I cannot determinwe what exactly it sees as the problem. The flagged button is "Home" in the navigation bar.
